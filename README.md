# Overview
This project allows you to use a USB mouse on an Amiga computer. It essentially converts a USB mouse to generate a quadrature signal stream. There are many variants of such a project available, either using this micro controller or others, however I'm using this project as an opportunity to learn more about the WCH55x micro controller.
